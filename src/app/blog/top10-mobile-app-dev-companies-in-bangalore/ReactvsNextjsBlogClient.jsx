    question: "Can I use React without Next.js?",
    answer: "Yes, React can be used independently for building single-page applications and dynamic UIs."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Next.js without knowing React?",
    answer: "No, since Next.js is built on top of React, you need to be familiar with React concepts to use Next.js effectively."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Next.js harder to learn than React?",
    answer: "Yes, due to its additional features like SSR, SSG, and routing, Next.js has a steeper learning curve."
  },
  {
    question: "Which is better for SEO, React or Next.js?",
    answer: "Next.js is better for SEO as it offers server-side rendering and static site generation."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I learn React before Next.js?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Since Next.js is built on top of React, understanding React first will make learning Next.js much easier."
